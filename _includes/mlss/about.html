                The goal of {{ site.inline-logo }} is threefold:
            </p>

            <p>
                1. Inspiration: to inspire the readers to be thinkers and researchers. They will find new ways to challenge their intellect and understand the world around them. Those engaged in STEM will find inspiration from Gita and vice versa.
            </p>

            <p>
                2. Engagement: to engage with different STEM subjects to stimulate fresh insights in the light of Gita and vice versa.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. Accessibility: to make the concepts discussed in Gita accessible to those engaged in STEM areas and vice versa. This will help those engaged in one to appreciate the richness and beauty of the other.
            </p>
